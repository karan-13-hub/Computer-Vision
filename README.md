# All assignments done as part of the Computer Vision course at IIIT- Hyderabad during Spring 2021.
## Assignment 1
 - Implementation of DLT for camera calibration
 - Used Zhang's method for camera calibration

## Assignment 2
 - Image Mosaicing- Stitching images together using SIFT to find matches between two images and consequently estimating the homography matrix.
 - Stereo Correspondences

## Assignment 3
 - Implementation of the famous Grabcut algorithm for image segmentation.

## Assignment 4
 - Implementation of the famous Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection.

## Assignment 5
 - Designed a custom CNN using pytorch and analysed the effect of the following hyperparameters-
 - With Batch Norm
 - Adding new layers
 - With Dropout
 - Different activation functions at the end
 - Different pooling strategies
 - Different optimizers
 - Basic Augmentation like Rotation, Translation, Color Change
 - Used the fastai library to perform transfer learning and train a food-type detection model.
